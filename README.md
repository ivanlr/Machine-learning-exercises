# Machine-learning-exercises
Some machine learning exercises by the hand of Coursera (all of them using Octave). Concretely the machine learning course of the Stanford University.
Main scripts are "ex1.m" and "ex1_multi.m" each one for the exercises 1 and 2. 
The first exercise is about linear regression with one variable, and the second one implements linear regression to a dataset with multiple variables.
